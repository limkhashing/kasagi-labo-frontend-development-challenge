## Current Limitations

1. **`DetailsScreen` not able to Deeplink:**  
   The `DetailsScreen` currently cannot be opened via deeplink because it requires a full `AnimeDetails` object. To support deeplinking, the structure should be updated to fetch details from an API using an `mal_id`

2. **Hardcoded Genres:**  
   Genre data is hardcoded now for demo purposes. In a production app, genres should be fetched dynamically from an API.

3. **Checkbox API Calls:**  
   Each time a checkbox is toggled, an API call is made. This could slow down the app due to multiple requests. Maybe we can do debounce or batch the requests to improve the UX.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more tests for additional screens and integration scenarios.
2. Implement deeplink for `DetailsScreen` and share functionality for sharing Anime
3. Replace checkboxes with a dropdown that supports multi-select for better UX.
4. Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
